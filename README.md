# Michael Scahid, Phd


With a wealth of experience spanning full stack data science, I bring a holistic approach to every project, from data research and preprocessing to harnessing advanced Python skills and a deep understanding of diverse deep learning models. My journey as a Data Scientist at Northwestern Feinberg School of Medicine's Department of Neuroscience has been marked by leading the development of a robust machine learning codebase, steering multimodal time series predictions, and nurturing a dynamic team. Open-source Python software bearing my contributions has gained widespread adoption, and my innovative work in automating data workflows has led to both increased funding and operational efficiency. Furthermore, my tenure as a Research Scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison's Department of Medicine, where I directed intricate research efforts, secured substantial funding, and played a pivotal role in optimizing data pipelines, has enriched my multifaceted skill set. My passion for knowledge dissemination is evident in my role as a workshop pioneer, facilitating the growth of junior talents. My journey embodies a commitment to innovation, teamwork, and impactful contributions across the data science landscape.
