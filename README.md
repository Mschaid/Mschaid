## About me
I am a Chicago based data scientist and neuroscientist with Over 13 years of experience in applied research, data analysis, and data science. I have advanced experience with Python and related data science ecosystems (tensorflow, pytroch, numpy, pandas, polars). Experience with software engineering practices such unix systems, git/ version control, logging, unit testing, APIs and documentation. Understanding of statistical, machine learning and deep learning fundamentals. Experience with cutting edge deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, gradient boosted trees, and reinforcement learning algorithms. Familiar with data engineer practices, such as distributed computing, data models and pipelining systems.  Through the combination of modern data techniques, open-source tool development and collaborative science I aim to bridge the gap between technology, discovery, and health care.
